# 🌱 Phenological Example – OBINexus Happiness Compute

This project demonstrates how to build and explore a **phenological data structure** — a hybrid of a **Trie** (prefix tree) and an **AVL-balanced child set**. It enables us to model **phenotypes** (structured concepts like *happiness, values, sounds, states of mind*) as computational objects.

Instead of just holding characters, each node carries **meaning**: scores, traits, and metadata. This makes it a **foundation for happiness computing** and a building block in the **OBINexus Consciousness Preservation Framework**.

## 🔧 Core Building Blocks

### 1. `struct Phenotype`
Every concept we track has:
* `score` → quantitative value (e.g. 0.72 happiness strength)
* `visits` → how many times it's been accessed
* `qual` → qualitative traits (bitmask flags)
* `meta` → free text to explain its meaning

### 2. `struct TrieNode`
* Holds a **character key**
* Connects to children stored as an **AVL tree** (`struct AVLChild`)
* Can optionally attach a `Phenotype` if the path represents a complete token

### 3. `struct AVLChild`
* Keeps children **ordered** and **balanced** for fast lookups
* Ensures `O(log n)` insertion and traversal

Together, these structures let us index, store, and retrieve **concepts about happiness and human traits** with efficiency and clarity.

## 🧮 The Happiness Formula

This system encodes Seligman's famous equation:

```
H = S + C + V
```

Where:
* **S** = set range (baseline genetics, modeled as *core traits*)
* **C** = circumstances (context, modeled as *metadata*)
* **V** = voluntary variables (habits, choices, modeled as *qualitative flags*)

Our trie lets us combine **words**, **scores**, and **traits** into a computational representation of happiness.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Build and Run
```bash
# Compile the project
chmod +x build_debug.sh
./build_debug.sh

# Run the example
./phenotype
```

### Expected Output
```
Found phenotype -> score 0.72 meta=root concept
Enumerate all tokens:
token='phenotype'   score=0.720 visits=1 qual=0x3 meta=root concept
token='phenovalude' score=0.850 visits=0 qual=0x8 meta=value metric
token='phoneme'     score=0.450 visits=0 qual=0x4 meta=sound unit
```

Each token represents:
* A **concept key** (`phenotype`, `phenovalude`, `phoneme`)
* A **score** (strength or happiness value)
* A **qual flag** (qualitative bitmask)
* A **meta description** (human-readable label)

---

## 📊 Quality Flags System

The system uses bitmask flags to represent qualitative traits:

```c
typedef enum {
    QUAL_NONE = 0,
    QUAL_RESILIENT = 1<<0,  // 0x1
    QUAL_CREATIVE  = 1<<1,  // 0x2
    QUAL_ANXIOUS   = 1<<2,  // 0x4
    QUAL_OPTIMIST  = 1<<3,  // 0x8
} QualFlags;
```

Combine traits using bitwise OR:
```c
QUAL_RESILIENT | QUAL_CREATIVE = 0x3  // Both resilient and creative
```

---

## 🌍 Applications

* **Happiness Computing** → explore how traits and choices affect authentic happiness
* **Advertising / Marketing** → design campaigns aligned with optimism, creativity, or resilience
* **Consciousness Preservation** → record structured "phenotypic states" for long-term self-mapping
* **Personal Development** → create personalized growth plans based on computational models of traits

## 👩‍💻 For New Phenological Developers

If you're new to this field, think of it like this:

* A **trie** is a tree of letters → it builds words
* We've extended it: now each "word" has **meaning** attached (scores, traits, labels)
* This lets us **compute happiness** as if it were structured data

It's both **mathematical** and **human-friendly**: We can run algorithms, but also explain results in plain language.

### Key API Functions

```c
// Insert a new phenotype concept
void patrie_insert(TrieNode *root, const char *key, 
                  double score, QualFlags qual, const char *meta);

// Look up an existing phenotype (increments visit counter)
Phenotype* patrie_lookup(TrieNode *root, const char *key);

// Enumerate all stored concepts
void patrie_enumerate(TrieNode *root, token_cb cb, void *ctx);
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Data Structure Complexity
* **Insertion**: O(m + log k) where m = key length, k = children per node
* **Lookup**: O(m + log k)
* **Enumeration**: O(n) where n = total nodes

### Memory Management
* All memory is properly allocated/freed
* No memory leaks (tested with valgrind)
* Safe string handling with custom `my_strdup()`

### AVL Tree Properties
* Self-balancing binary search tree for child nodes
* Guarantees O(log k) access time even with many children
* Maintains alphabetical ordering for consistent enumeration

* [ ] Extend qualitative flags with richer **positive psychology traits**
* [ ] Build APIs for **OBINexus Happiness Framework** integration
* [ ] Experiment with simulations (e.g., "what if someone increases gratitude by 10%?")
* [ ] Add JSON import/export for phenotype data
* [ ] Implement prefix search and fuzzy matching
* [ ] Create visualization tools for phenotype networks
